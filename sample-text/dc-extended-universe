The DC Extended Universe (DCEU) is an American media franchise and shared universe centered on a series of superhero films based on characters that appeared in American comic books by DC Comics, produced by DC Films and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. The franchise also includes comic books, short films, novels, and video games. The DCEU, much like the original DC Universe in comic books, was established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters.

Warner Bros. had plans to bring various DC Comics superheroes together in films since 2002, when Wolfgang Petersen was set to direct a crossover of the Batman and Superman film franchises. After a planned Justice League film was put on hold and the success of The Dark Knight in 2008, Warner Bros. decided to focus on individual franchises but began to start building a shared universe to compete with Marvel Studios' Marvel Cinematic Universe in 2011. The DCEU was originally planned to center around five films directed by Zack Snyder, but DC Films downplayed the shared nature of the universe in order to allow greater autonomy for the individual filmmakers in 2018.

The first DCEU film is Man of Steel (2013), a reboot of the Superman film series, followed by Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), which served as a reboot of the Batman film series. These films were followed by Suicide Squad (2016), Wonder Woman (2017), Justice League (2017), Aquaman (2018), Shazam! (2019), Birds of Prey (2020), Wonder Woman 1984 (2020), and The Suicide Squad (2021). The franchise will continue with Black Adam, The Flash, and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom in 2022, and Shazam! Fury of the Gods and Blue Beetle in 2023. Additionally, the DCEU expanded to exclusive releases on the streaming service HBO Max with Zack Snyder's Justice League in 2021, and will continue with the television series Peacemaker and the film Batgirl in 2022. The studio also has a number of films scheduled for their 2022–2023 film slate, including: Green Lantern Corps, Static Shock and Supergirl.

The DCEU is the eleventh-highest-grossing film franchise of all time, having grossed over $5.8 billion at the global box office. Its highest-grossing film, Aquaman, earned over $1.15 billion worldwide and became the highest-grossing DC Comics-based film to date. The DCEU has received a generally mixed critical response.

 Etymology 
Upon announcement of the film series, the universe was commonly called the "DC Cinematic Universe" by fans and the media, in keeping with the naming convention of the already established Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Keith Staskiewicz, writing for Entertainment Weekly, jokingly coined the term "DC Extended Universe™" in an article about Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice on July 1, 2015. This term and the abbreviation DCEU quickly spread among the press and fans thinking of it as the official name of the franchise over the following years. According to Vulture writer Abraham Riesman, DC confirmed to him in September 2017 that the term was not used internally and they did not consider it official. In 2016, as part of DC Films Presents: Dawn of the Justice League, both Geoff Johns and Kevin Smith referred to the franchise's name as being the "Justice League Universe". During the DC Films panel at San Diego Comic-Con 2018, a video banner displayed the words "Welcome to the Worlds of DC", after showcasing some upcoming films. As a result, some media outlets interpreted this as DC officially naming their shared film universe as the "Worlds of DC". However, in March 2020, Jim Lee referred to the franchise as the DC Extended Universe at C2E2. The franchise was officially titled DC Extended Universe when the WarnerMedia streaming service HBO Max launched the following May.

 Development 
 Film 
In 2002, Wolfgang Petersen was set to direct a Batman vs. Superman film from a script by Akiva Goldsman. Warner Bros. canceled development to focus on individual Superman and Batman projects after J. J. Abrams submitted another draft for Superman: Flyby. In February 2007, Warner Bros. hired husband and wife duo Michele and Kieran Mulroney to write a script for a Justice League film. Christian Bale, who starred as Batman in Batman Begins (2005), was not approached to reprise the role, nor was Brandon Routh, who starred as Superman in Superman Returns (2006). George Miller was hired to direct the film, reportedly titled Justice League Mortal, with Armie Hammer cast as Batman, D. J. Cotrona as Superman, Adam Brody as Flash, Santiago Cabrera as Aquaman, Common as Green Lantern, Megan Gale as Wonder Woman, Hugh Keays-Byrne as Martian Manhunter and Jay Baruchel as Maxwell Lord. The project was put on indefinite hold in January 2008, after failing to secure tax breaks for filming in Australia, as well as the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike preventing progress on the script.

In 2013, a reboot of the Superman franchise, Man of Steel, was set to lay the groundwork for future DC films. The film contained references to other characters in the DC Universe, so if it were a success, it could launch a shared universe. At San Diego Comic-Con in July, one month after Man of Steels release, Warner Bros. announced that Superman and Batman would meet for the first time in a cinematic format in a sequel to Man of Steel, establishing the shared universe. In October 2014, a slate of ten DC films was announced, with initial plans of those universe-driven films spanning through 2020. In June 2015, Warner Bros. president of creative development Greg Silverman explained DC's approach to their cinematic universe, saying, "We ... take these beloved characters and put them in the hands of master filmmakers and make sure they all coordinate with each other."

[[File:Geoff Johns by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|left|Geoff Johns has served in various positions in the DC Films production studio, and for the DCEU.]]
In May 2016, following criticism of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Warner Bros. established a DC Films division with DC's chief creative officer Geoff Johns and Warner Bros. executive vice president Jon Berg as its heads to oversee production and form a cohesive creative direction for the franchise. DC Films would not be fully autonomous, as Johns reported to DC president Diane Nelson and Berg reported to Silverman. Charles Roven was also moved from his day-by-day producer role on future DC films, which he had served since 2005's Batman Begins, to an administrative executive producer role. In December, Silverman was ousted from his role in Warner Bros., and Toby Emmerich was promoted to president and chief content officer in his place. By January 2017, Johns and Berg reported to Emmerich. Following the financial and critical success of Wonder Woman in June 2017, Johns stated that moving forward the films would focus on the heart, humor, hope, heroics, and optimism of the characters. As a result of Justice League's underperformance at the box office, Berg left his position by January 2018 and became a production partner with Roy Lee. DC also sought to deemphasize the shared nature of their films, with Diane Nelson stating, "Our intention, certainly, moving forward is using the continuity to help make sure nothing is diverging in a way that doesn't make sense, but there's no insistence upon an overall storyline or interconnectivity in that universe... Moving forward, you'll see the DC movie universe being a universe, but one that comes from the heart of the filmmaker who's creating them."

In January 2018, Walter Hamada was appointed the President of DC Films and co-runner of the DCEU, replacing Berg. The following month, Chantal Nong was named Vice President of DC Films. The pair were hired to oversee the franchise with Johns, as the key production team managers. However, Johns stepped down from his executive roles at DC in June 2018, and created a production company, Mad Ghost Productions, to have a greater hands-on role in various DC media as a writer and producer. After the financial success of Aquaman, Warner Bros. CEO Kevin Tsujihara said the upcoming slate of DC films would be focused on individual character stories instead of interconnectivity. In 2021, WarnerMedia reversed course and announced that future films would once again be interconnected.

 Television 
In May 2020, WarnerMedia launched the streaming service HBO Max. In September, HBO Max ordered Peacemaker, the DCEU's first television series and a spin-off of the film The Suicide Squad. After this announcement, Walter Hamada stated that DC Films was interested in producing spin-off series for every film in the DCEU slate for HBO Max. In February 2021, HBO Max and executive producer J. J. Abrams began developing multiple series based on the individual team members of the Justice League Dark, with a plan to eventually culminate these projects in a crossover and team-up miniseries.

 Man of Steel (2013) 

[[File:Zack Snyder by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.70|Zack Snyder, the director of Man of Steel, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, and Justice League.]]

Kal-El / Clark Kent, who arrived on Earth years ago as an infant from Krypton, struggles with why he was sent to Earth. Raised by his adoptive parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent, Clark adopts the persona "Superman", and learns if his abilities are meant to maintain peace or conquer the world.

During story discussions for The Dark Knight Rises, David S. Goyer told Christopher Nolan his idea regarding how to present Superman in a modern context. Impressed with Goyer's concept, Nolan pitched the idea to the studio, who hired Nolan to produce and Goyer to write based on the financial and critical success of The Dark Knight. Zack Snyder was hired in October 2010 to direct the film. In January 2011, Henry Cavill was cast as Clark Kent / Superman. Other cast members included Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Michael Shannon as the villain General Zod, Diane Lane as Martha Kent, Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent, Russell Crowe as Jor-El, and Laurence Fishburne as Perry White. Principal photography began on August 1, 2011. Man of Steel released in North America on June 14, 2013.

 Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) 

Gotham City-based vigilante Batman travels to Metropolis to preemptively combat Superman, fearing what would happen if the latter is kept unchecked, while another threat endangers humankind.

By June 2013, Warner Bros. were fast-tracking a sequel to Man of Steel, with Snyder and Goyer returning as director and writer, respectively. Nolan was involved in an advisory role as executive producer. In July, at the San Diego Comic-Con, Warner Bros. revealed that the sequel would include Batman in a main role, and serve as a reboot of the Batman film series. According to Snyder, the film took inspiration from the comic The Dark Knight Returns. Cavill, Adams, Lane, and Fishburne reprised their roles. In August, Ben Affleck was cast as Bruce Wayne / Batman. In December, Gal Gadot was cast as Diana Prince / Wonder Woman, marking the character's first appearance in a live-action theatrical film. Later in the month, Chris Terrio was hired to rewrite Goyer's script. In January 2014, the film was delayed from its July 17, 2015, release date to May 6, 2016, to give the filmmakers "time to realize fully their vision, given the complex visual nature of the story". Later that month, Jesse Eisenberg and Jeremy Irons joined the cast as Lex Luthor and Alfred Pennyworth, respectively. In May 2014, the film's title was revealed to be Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Initial filming occurred on October 19, 2013, at East Los Angeles College, before full principal photography began on May 21, 2014, in Detroit. Production also took place in Illinois, New Mexico, Africa and the South Pacific. After another date change, the film was released in North America on March 25, 2016.

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is set 18 months after the events of Man of Steel. The film introduced Ezra Miller as Barry Allen / The Flash, Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry / Aquaman, Ray Fisher as Victor Stone / Cyborg, and Joe Morton as Dr. Silas Stone. Steppenwolf is also introduced, who served as the main antagonist in Justice League, through a brief scene. The scene was not included in the film's theatrical release, but instead was revealed online by Warner Bros. on March 28, before being included in the Ultimate Edition home video release.

 Suicide Squad (2016) 

[[File:David Ayer by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.70|David Ayer, the writer and director of Suicide Squad.]]

After the death of Superman, a secret government agency recruits imprisoned supervillains to execute dangerous black ops missions and rescue the world from a powerful threat, in exchange for clemency.

In February 2009, prior to the development of the DCEU, Warner Bros. was developing a Suicide Squad film, with Dan Lin producing and Justin Marks writing the script. In October 2014, Suicide Squad was announced by Warner Bros., with David Ayer confirmed as director. In December, it was revealed that Ayer would also be writing the screenplay. The main cast included Will Smith as Deadshot, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, Jared Leto as the Joker, Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang, Jay Hernandez as El Diablo, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Killer Croc, Karen Fukuhara as Katana, Cara Delevingne as Enchantress, Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, and Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag. Tom Hardy was originally cast as Rick Flag, but dropped out due to scheduling issues with his film The Revenant. Principal photography commenced April 13, 2015, and took place in and around Toronto. Filming concluded August 28, 2015. Suicide Squad underwent reshoots to give the film a more lighthearted and comedic element akin to the trailers for the film, especially following the critical failure of the more serious Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Suicide Squad was released in North America on August 5, 2016.

Suicide Squad is set after the events of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Affleck as Bruce Wayne / Batman and Miller as Barry Allen / The Flash made appearances in the film. In a mid-credits scene, Waller meets Wayne in a restaurant and hands him a dossier containing information on future members of the Justice League.

 Wonder Woman (2017) 

[[File:Patty Jenkins by Gage Skidmore (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.70|Patty Jenkins, the director of Wonder Woman and Wonder Woman 1984.]]

Diana of Themyscira, an Amazon warrior who also is the demigoddess daughter of the god Zeus, uses her talents and abilities in order to help humanity during World War I.

Gal Gadot was cast as Diana Prince / Wonder Woman in December 2013 and signed a three-picture deal which included a solo film. In October 2014, Wonder Woman was announced by Warner Bros. In November, Michelle MacLaren was confirmed to direct the film from a screenplay by Jason Fuchs. In April 2015, MacLaren left the project due to creative differences. Later that month, Patty Jenkins was announced as the new director. In July, Chris Pine was cast as Steve Trevor. Other cast members include Connie Nielsen as Queen Hippolyta, Robin Wright as General Antiope, Danny Huston as Erich Ludendorff, Elena Anaya as Doctor Poison, and David Thewlis as Ares. Filming began in November 2015 and took place in the United Kingdom, France and Italy. Wonder Woman was released in North America on June 2, 2017.

 Justice League (2017) 

Motivated by Superman's death at the hands of Doomsday, Batman and Wonder Woman assemble a team of metahumans to stop the threat of Steppenwolf, who is in search of three Mother Boxes scattered across Earth.

By June 2013, Goyer was set to write Justice League as part of a three-film deal he signed for Man of Steel. In April 2014, it was announced that Snyder would return as director. The film was announced in October as Justice League Part One. In March 2016, it was confirmed that Chris Terrio had written the script, who said that the film would not be as tonally dark as Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. In June, Geoff Johns announced that the title had been changed to simply Justice League. Affleck, Cavill, Gadot, Momoa, Miller, Fisher, Irons, Lane, Adams, Eisenberg, Nielsen, Wright, and Morton reprised their respective roles from previous films. Ciarán Hinds provides the voice and performance capture for Steppenwolf. Beginning on April 11, 2016, filming took place at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden, in England, as well as locations around London and in Iceland. Filming concluded in October 2016. In May 2017, Snyder stepped down from his duties on the film due to his daughter's death; Joss Whedon filled his position on post-production, with additional scenes being written and directed by him. Though Whedon was not officially credited for his role as post-production director, he completed enough additional work for a screenwriting credit on the film. Justice League was released worldwide on November 17, 2017.

Justice League introduced various characters, including J. K. Simmons as James Gordon, Amber Heard as Mera, and Billy Crudup as Henry Allen. Additionally, Joe Manganiello as Slade Wilson / Deathstroke was also introduced in a post-credits scene, teasing an alliance between him, Lex Luthor, and possibly the Legion of Doom. Kiersey Clemons as Iris West and Willem Dafoe as Nuidis Vulko were to be introduced but their scenes were ultimately cut from the film.

 Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) 

The divisive reaction towards the final highlighted cut of Justice League, with Zack Snyder leaving directorial duties and the final cut of the film in the hands of Joss Whedon, had led to a campaign for a "Snyder Cut" of the film. Arguments were made that Snyder's vision would be more cohesive to the previous films than the actual theatrical cut, which Snyder has refused to see. Warner Bros. initially remained silent regarding any intention of making a "Snyder Cut".

In March 2019, Snyder confirmed his original cut does exist, and stated that it is up to Warner Bros. to release it. Despite this, in November, Variety reported that Warner Bros. was unlikely to release Snyder's version of Justice League in theaters or on HBO Max, calling it a "pipe dream". In December, however, Snyder posted a photo in his Vero account, which showed boxes with tapes labeled "Z.S. J.L Director's cut", and with the caption "Is it real? Does it exist? Of course it does." On May 20, 2020, Snyder officially announced that HBO Max would be releasing his cut of Justice League on their service on March 18, 2021. The new cut reportedly cost $70+ million to complete the special effects, musical score, and editing, and is presented in aspect ratios of 1.33:1 on streaming & 1.43:1 for a limited IMAX theatrical release. Snyder stated this version is intended to not affect the future of the DCEU continuity, but that it takes place in a slightly alternate universe. Despite previous reports describing it as a miniseries, Snyder described his cut as being a four-hour film to be viewed in "one shot." Affleck, Miller, Fisher, Heard, and Manganiello returned to their respective roles for additional photography, in order to finish the project. In January 2021, Snyder confirmed that work on the cut had been completed. Actors from the DCEU who did not appear in the theatrical cut have appeared in this version, such as Harry Lennix as Calvin Swanwick (revealed to be Martian Manhunter in disguise), Willem Dafoe as Nuidis Vulko, and Jared Leto as the Joker. Characters who were intended to debut in Snyder's original version of the film before their scenes were cut also appear, such as Darkseid (portrayed by Ray Porter), DeSaad (portrayed by Peter Guinness), Iris West (portrayed by Kiersey Clemons), Ryan Choi (portrayed by Zheng Kai), several Green Lanterns, as well as Granny Goodness.

 Aquaman (2018) 

[[File:James Wan at the 2016 San Diego Comic Con (27976781713) (1).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.57|James Wan, the director of Aquaman and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.]]

Arthur Curry, a half-Atlantean assistant lighthouse keeper, sets out to lead the underwater kingdom of Atlantis against his half-brother, King Orm, who seeks to unite the seven underwater kingdoms against the surface world.

In June 2014, Jason Momoa was cast as Arthur Curry / Aquaman. By August, Will Beall and Kurt Johnstad were writing competing scripts for the character's solo film. Aquaman was announced in October. In June 2015, James Wan was hired as director, as well as to oversee the screenplay by Johnstad. In November 2015, David Leslie Johnson was hired to write a new script. In July 2016, Beall returned to write the script, based on a story treatment by Wan and Geoff Johns. Johnson worked on a rewrite of Beall's script with Wan and producer Peter Safran. In December 2016, Patrick Wilson was cast as Orm / Ocean Master, the half-brother of Aquaman and the main antagonist of the film. In January 2017, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II was cast in the role of villain Black Manta. Heard reprised her role as Mera from Justice League. Other cast members include Willem Dafoe as Nuidis Vulko, Temuera Morrison as Aquaman's father Tom Curry, Nicole Kidman as Aquaman's mother Queen Atlanna, and Dolph Lundgren as King Nereus. Principal photography began on May 2, 2017, in Queensland, Australia, and wrapped on October 21, 2017. Aquaman was released in North America on December 21, 2018.

Aquaman is set after the events of Justice League, though critics have noticed numerous inconsistencies between the two theatrically released films. Furthermore, Momoa claimed that the film takes place after "Zack's cut", with the ending of that version of the film directly tying into the events of Aquaman.

 Shazam! (2019) 

[[File:David F. Sandberg by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.72|David F. Sandberg, the director of Shazam! and Shazam! Fury of the Gods.]]

By speaking "Shazam", Billy Batson, a 14-year-old foster child, can turn into an adult superhero, courtesy of an ancient wizard. He attempts to master his powers and defeat the evil forces controlled by Dr. Thaddeus Sivana.

In August 2014, Dwayne Johnson announced his attachment to a project about the superhero Shazam, formerly known as Captain Marvel. In September, Johnson was revealed to be portraying the antihero Black Adam, Shazam's nemesis in the film, with Darren Lemke set to write the script. In October, Warner Bros. announced Shazam as a film in its upcoming slate. By January 2017, Henry Gayden was working on the script. In July, it was confirmed that David F. Sandberg would direct Shazam!, and that Johnson would no longer appear, instead starring in a Black Adam solo film. Pre-production began in August. By October, Zachary Levi was cast as Shazam, and in November, Asher Angel was cast as Shazam's child-age alter ego, Billy Batson. The film's primary villain is Doctor Sivana, with Mark Strong in the role. Other cast members include Jack Dylan Grazer, Grace Fulton, Jovan Armand, Ian Chen, and Faithe Herman as Batson's foster siblings, Cooper Andrews and Marta Milans as Batson's foster parents, and Djimon Hounsou as the wizard Shazam, who gives Batson his powers. The film began principal photography in Toronto on January 29, 2018, and wrapped on May 11, 2018, with most of the filming taking place at Pinewood Toronto Studios, among other locations around the city. Shazam! was released in North America on April 5, 2019.

Shazam! is set after the events of Justice League. Superman makes a cameo appearance at the end of the film, however, his face is not shown as Henry Cavill was unable to reprise the role due to scheduling conflicts. The villain Mister Mind is introduced in a mid-credits scene.

 Birds of Prey (2020) 

[[File:Cathy Yan, January 2020.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cathy Yan, the director of Birds of Prey.]]

Since the events of Suicide Squad, Harley Quinn has left the Joker. When Cassandra Cain, a young girl, comes across a diamond belonging to crime lord Black Mask, Harley joins forces with Black Canary, Huntress, and Renee Montoya to help protect her.

By November 2016, a film based on the female superhero team Birds of Prey was in development, with Christina Hodson signed on as screenwriter. By April 2018, Warner Bros. selected Cathy Yan as director, with Margot Robbie, Sue Kroll, and Bryan Unkless serving as producers. Robbie reprised her role as Harley Quinn from Suicide Squad. The film is the first theatrical R-rated installment in the franchise and has a smaller budget than most of the other films. In addition to Robbie's starring role, the team roster also includes Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, Rosie Perez, and Ella Jay Basco as Huntress, Black Canary, Renee Montoya, and Cassandra Cain, respectively. Black Mask serves as the film's primary antagonist with Ewan McGregor portraying the character, and Chris Messina portraying Victor Zsasz. The film began pre-production in late July 2018. Principal photography commenced on January 15, 2019, in Los Angeles, and lasted until April 15, 2019. In November 2018, Robbie revealed the full title of the film as Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn). Birds of Prey held its world premiere in London on January 29, 2020, and was released in North America on February 7, 2020.

Birds of Prey is set after the events of Suicide Squad.

 Wonder Woman 1984 (2020) 

Diana Prince comes into conflict with the Soviet Union during the Cold War in the 1980s and finds two formidable foes in the form of the Cheetah and Maxwell Lord.

By June 2017, Geoff Johns and Patty Jenkins had begun work on the story treatment for a Wonder Woman sequel. By July, Johns was working on the script. That same month, the sequel was officially announced at San Diego Comic-Con. Gadot reprised her role as Wonder Woman. By September, Jenkins signed a deal to return as director, and brought on David Callaham to pen the script with her and Johns. Pre-production had begun by early December 2017. In March 2018, Kristen Wiig was cast to portray the film's primary antagonist, Barbara Ann Minerva / Cheetah, and Pedro Pascal was cast as Maxwell Lord. Production began on June 13, 2018, around the District of Columbia and Northern Virginia. Other filming locations include the Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden in the United Kingdom and the islands of Tenerife and Fuerteventura in Spain. Wonder Woman 1984  was released in the United States on HBO Max and in theaters simultaneously on December 25, 2020, after its release was delayed twice from an original June 5, 2020 date due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Dreamstone—a gem associated with the characters Doctor Destiny and Dream of the Endless in the comics—plays a significant role in the film. In a mid-credits scene, Lynda Carter, who starred as Wonder Woman in the character's 1970s television series, was introduced as Asteria, a legendary Amazon warrior who possessed ancient golden armor that Gadot's Wonder Woman wore in the film.

 The Suicide Squad (2021) 

[[File:James Gunn (28557194032) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.70|James Gunn, the writer and director of The Suicide Squad.]]

Waller sends a new Task Force X, consisting of both old and new members, on a mission to destroy a Nazi-era laboratory containing experiments.

In March 2016, a Suicide Squad sequel was announced to be in development, with Ayer returning as director. Adam Cozad was hired to write the script by March 2017. By July 2017, a new story treatment was written by Zak Penn. In September 2017, Gavin O'Connor was hired as director and writer after Ayer dropped out. O'Connor completed the script with David Bar Katz and Todd Stashwick by September 2018. The next month, O'Connor left the project as Warner Bros. believed the script was too similar to Birds of Prey. In January 2019, the film was re-titled The Suicide Squad, with James Gunn directing, from a new script he wrote. Gunn chose the project over various other films Warner Bros. had in development, including a Superman film. In March, Idris Elba joined the cast. He was initially hired to replace Smith as Deadshot, who dropped out due to scheduling conflicts, but it was later decided that Elba would play a new character so Smith could return in the future. Margot Robbie, Joel Kinnaman, Jai Courtney, and Viola Davis reprised their roles from the first film, while David Dastmalchian, Steve Agee, Michael Rooker, Peter Capaldi, Taika Waititi, Alice Braga, Sean Gunn, Daniela Melchior, Juan Diego Botto, Storm Reid, Pete Davidson, Nathan Fillion, Sylvester Stallone, Flula Borg, John Cena, and Joaquín Cosío, among others, joined the cast. Production began on September 20, 2019, at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Atlanta, with additional filming following in Panama. The Suicide Squad began its international release on July 30, 2021 in the United Kingdom, and was released theatrically and on the streaming platform HBO Max in the United States on August 5.

 Black Adam (2022) 

[[File:Jaume Collet-Serra (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.65|Jaume Collet-Serra, the director of Black Adam]]

In September 2014, after being considered to play Shazam and Lobo, Dwayne Johnson was cast as Black Adam, a central villain of DC's Shazam franchise. The character was intended to be introduced in Shazam!, but the film's production studios chose to divide the narrative to focus on Black Adam's origin. Johnson, who is also attached as producer, has stated the two characters will cross paths in a future film. Other DC characters, including the Justice Society of America, will factor into the plot of Black Adam. In October 2017, Adam Sztykiel was hired to write the script. Co-producer Hiram Garcia stated the film will be gritty and violent, similar to the comics. In June 2019, Jaume Collet-Serra was announced as director for the film, with Beau Flynn, Johnson, Hiram Garcia, Dany Garcia, and Scott Sheldon attached as producers. The Justice Society of America will appear in the film, with Noah Centineo, Aldis Hodge, Quintessa Swindell and Pierce Brosnan cast as Atom Smasher, Hawkman, Cyclone, and Doctor Fate, respectively. By that September, Rory Haines and Sohrab Noshirvani had written a new draft of the script. In February 2021, Marwan Kenzari was cast in an undisclosed role. Filming began on April 10, 2021, and wrapped on July 15, for a scheduled release date of July 29, 2022.

Over the next two years, Seth Grahame-Smith and Rick Famuyiwa had individually dropped out as director due to creative differences with the studio.

By July 2019, Daley and Goldstein had left the project, while Andy Muschietti and Christina Hodson were hired to replace them as director and screenwriter, respectively. Barbara Muschietti and Michael Disco will serve as producers. In January 2020, Andy Muschietti reaffirmed the film will include elements from the Flashpoint comic book arc.

In July 2019, Christopher McQuarrie said that he had sent a written proposal for the film to Warner Bros. over a year prior, which had ties to the Man of Steel sequel, but he had moved on to other projects due to what he perceived as no movement on further developing the film.

In February 2018, McKay stated the script was nearing its final draft.

In July 2013, DC Entertainment president Diane Nelson reiterated the company’s intentions to make the film. In October 2021, Sonnenfeld revealed that the film's story was still being written. By December, a separate animated film based on the Metal Men was in development at Warner Animation Group.
  By December 2018, a Plastic Man film was in development with Amanda Idoko hired to write the script. The plot is described as a comedy-action adventure. In December 2020, Cat Vasko was hired to do a rewrite of Idoko's screenplay, with the project reworked to be a female-centered movie.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, a non-white actor is being sought as Constantine.
 Justice League Dark: In January 2013, Guillermo del Toro began developing a film centered on the Justice League Dark and submitted a script in November 2014, but was no longer attached by June 2015. In August 2016, Doug Liman joined to direct with the title Dark Universe, alongside Scott Rudin producing and Michael Gilio rewriting the script. Liman left in May 2017 due to scheduling conflicts. In mid-2017, it was retitled Justice League Dark with Gerard Johnstone polishing the script. By April 2020, the project was being redeveloped as a series for HBO Max, with J. J. Abrams serving as an executive producer. According to Variety, Justice League Dark will likely premiere after the individual team members are introduced in their own series, similar to how Marvel Television's Netflix series individually premiered before crossing over in The Defenders (2017).

 Canceled and reworked projects 
Over the years, many projects that were at one point supposed to be part of the DCEU have either been moved into a different continuity or outright canceled:
  In July 2015, Ben Affleck was in negotiations to direct, produce, star in, and co-write (with Geoff Johns) a Batman film. Affleck was confirmed as the film's director at the San Diego Comic-Con 2016. Affleck later stated in January 2017 that he was unsure if he would direct the film, and stepped down as director later that month. In February, Matt Reeves was hired to direct and co-produce the film. Under Reeves, the film shifted focus towards a younger, more inexperienced iteration of the character while drawing more from the comics' roots in noir and detective fiction, and Affleck eventually left the project altogether, being replaced by Robert Pattinson as Batman and allowing the film to drop its connections to the DCEU, establishing it in a new standalone shared universe. In December 2020, Joe Manganiello, who was set to reprise his role as Deathstroke before Reeves took over, explained that the plot was tied to Justice League and featured Deathstroke attempting to ruin Batman's life as revenge for the death of his son. Batgirl and the Riddler would have also appeared in the film. Shortly following the release of Zack Snyder's Justice League, a campaign began on social media seeking for the revival of the project.
  In April 2014, Ray Fisher was cast as Victor Stone / Cyborg, and Warner Bros. announced a film centered around the character was in development the following October. Joe Morton was set to reprise his role as Dr. Silas Stone. In November 2017, Fisher stated the film would focus specifically on Cyborg, and that the cast and production team would be diverse. In August 2018, Morton commented that there were discussions to include scenes in Cyborg, that were cut during post-production on the theatrical release of Justice League that involved Cyborg. Fisher expressed his desire for Zack Snyder to direct the film, and pitched plot elements including the Phantom Limbs as the primary antagonists of the film. Cyborg was scheduled to be released on April 3, 2020, but was later delayed. In April 2020, Fisher confirmed that development on the project continued; though by 2021, amidst a dispute between the actor and Warner Bros. Pictures regarding an investigation in the reshoot process on Justice League, he stated that he would not play the role in any film that has Hamada's involvement. DC Films responded by stating that they will not recast the role. Fisher later commented that he would only reprise the role if Zack Snyder's cancelled Justice League sequel was to be revived. In March 2021, Fisher said that he is not opposed to reprising the role in future DCEU films, with the actor preferring Cyborg be directed by Snyder or Rick Famuyiwa.
  In October 2017, a film centered around Slade Wilson / Deathstroke was announced to be in development with Gareth Evans attached as screenwriter and director from a story by Joe Manganiello, who was also set to reprise his role from Justice League. The project was greenlit after Evans impressed executives with his pitch. By April 2020, Evans was no longer in negotiations to work on the project, stating that he had never been contractually involved with its development. He described the story as a "dark" and "unforgiving" origin story, similar to Korean noir films. In December 2020, after reprising the role in Zack Snyder's Justice League, Manganiello stated he and Snyder were working on projects featuring Deathstroke. In March 2021, after numerous delays, Manganiello confirmed that Deathstroke had been canceled because Warner Bros. did not consider it a priority. Manganiello stated that he wrote a "human and grounded" revenge backstory for the character, while preparing for the role in Justice League and Ben Affleck's The Batman. He had spent six months writing the script outline for the film that was pitched to the studio; with details including the character's time in the U.S. Military, his connection to the League of Shadows, as well as the characters Talia al Ghul, William Wintergreen, his wife Adeline Kane, and their children. The story included the events that would lead to the character's role in Affleck's film where he exacts revenge on Batman, who he blames for the death of his son. Manganiello noted that a revival was possible. Shortly after the release of Snyder's Cut of Justice League, a social media campaign was started as an attempt to persuade Warner Bros. to continue with the project. In April 2021 during Justice Con, Manganiello stated that the first project featuring the character that he is hoping gets greenlit is an origin story reworked as a series and released exclusively on HBO Max.
  Originally, the 2011 Green Lantern film was planned to be the first film in a shared DC cinematic universe. However, its planned sequels were canceled in September 2011 and the film was eventually left out of continuity due to its critical and financial disappointment. Despite this, Sinestro actor Mark Strong incorrectly referred to it as "part of the DCEU" in February 2019. The character is scheduled to be rebooted for the franchise continuity in Green Lantern Corps which is currently in development. Later, Zack Snyder considered having Ryan Reynolds return to play an "additional lantern...to fill out the corps" in his 2021 director's cut of Justice League. The film would eventually be retroactively established to be set on the world of Earth-12 in the Arrowverse crossover event "Crisis on Infinite Earths".
  In July 2017, a film featuring Harley Quinn and the Joker was announced to be in development with the working title of "Harley Quinn vs. the Joker", scheduled to begin production after The Suicide Squad. Glenn Ficarra and John Requa were hired as co-writers, co-directors, and co-producers. In September 2018, Ficarra and Requa said that the script was completed and submitted to Warner Bros., and that production would commence after Birds of Prey. The story would have explored the toxic relationship of the characters, combining the tones of Ficarra and Requa's previous works Bad Santa and This Is Us. The film was canceled by February 2019.
 Untitled Joker film: In June 2018, a film featuring the Joker entered development. Jared Leto would have served as an executive producer in addition to reprising his role as the Joker, as well as being involved with hiring the film's production crew. The film was intended to "pave the way" for all other Suicide Squad-related projects. By February 2019, the film had been canceled, and a Joker film unrelated to the DCEU was released later that year.
 Justice League sequels: In October 2014, Justice League Part Two was announced, with Snyder returning as director. In June 2016, Deborah Snyder revealed that Justice League would not be one film split in two. The film was scheduled to be released on June 14, 2019, but production was pushed back to accommodate The Batman. Joss Whedon, the director of Justice League reshoots, would eventually rework one of the film's post-credit scenes in order to tease the Injustice League as villains of a possible sequel. In October 2017, J. K. Simmons stated that work on the script was in-progress, while in December, Variety reported that there were "no immediate plans" for Snyder to return as director. Before his departure from DC Films, Snyder originally intended for the sequel to focus on the League's battle against the Injustice League, which would have consisted of Lex Luthor, Doctor Poison, Captain Cold, the Riddler, Ocean Master and Black Manta. The conflict would have resulted in the deaths of Wonder Woman and Aquaman. The film would have ended with Darkseid invading Earth and killing a pregnant Lois Lane, which would have made Superman susceptible to the Anti-Life Equation. By 2019, Warner Bros. had prioritized standalone films over the project, although Patty Jenkins noted she would be open to directing the next Justice League film. Zack Snyder's Justice League was considered "a storytelling cul-de-sac", with no sequels planned. Snyder said that he did not "have any expectation that there would be more movies than this. If that happened, that would be amazing — but that bridge is far away." He later added that Warner Bros. had "no appetite or interest" to have him direct more films. In January 2021, Ray Fisher stated that he would only be willing to reprise his role as Cyborg in a future DCEU film if a Justice League sequel were to be made by Snyder. The following month, Snyder said that he would return to direct the sequel if he was offered the chance. In March, storyboards created for Snyder's version of the sequel were displayed at the "Dreamscapes of Zack Snyder’s Justice League" exhibit in Dallas.′ The storyboards confirmed the existence of a second sequel, tentatively titled Justice League 2A, which was planned to be released in 2020. 2A would have been set five years after the previous film and would have saw the League using time travel to reverse Darkseid's invasion. Batman would have sacrificed his life while defending Lois Lane from Darkseid in the past, eventually creating an alternate timeline where Darkseid's invasion never occurred. Twenty years in the future, the son of Clark and Lois would have become the second Batman after Bruce. In August, producer Charles Roven confirmed the studio's continued interest in a Justice League sequel, however stating that it is still "a number of years away".
  In October 2014, the Man of Steel writer David S. Goyer was announced to developing a television series focused on the planet Krypton. During the development, Goyer revealed that the series would use unused concepts for the planet that were created for Man of Steel. In early marketing materials for the series and the first teaser that debuted at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con, the Superman logo designed for the DCEU films was used to represent the House of El, implying that the series would have been a direct prequel to Man of Steel. During the casting process, the production crew sought an actor who resembled a young Henry Cavill to portray Seg-El, Superman's grandfather, while Goyer stated that the series was planned to take place 200 years prior to the events of Man of Steel. Ultimately, all connections to Man of Steel were dropped by the series' release in March 2018. Executive producer Cameron Welsh later described the series as "adjacent" to both the DCEU and the Arrowverse.
 Man of Steel sequel: By October 2014, a sequel to Man of Steel was in development. In November 2016, Amy Adams stated that work had begun on the screenplay. In September 2017, Matthew Vaughn announced that he was having discussions with the studio to direct the film. In June 2018, Cavill revealed that he was preparing to reprise the role. By March 2019, Vaughn stated that discussions with Warner Bros. had ended, and he was no longer involved with development of the film. In discussing his work on the project he revealed that it was influenced by a previous trilogy pitch from 2008 that he had co-written with Mark Millar, with Vaughn describing the project as "a massive, uplifting, hopeful thing". In July 2019, Christopher McQuarrie said that he and Cavill had pitched a sequel idea to Warner Bros. over a year prior, with the plot having ties to Green Lantern Corps, but he moved on to other projects due to what he perceived as no movement on the films. Later, Michael B. Jordan had pitched his own take on the character, but was not ready to commit due to an already busy schedule. By November 2019, Warner Bros. had entered negotiations with J. J. Abrams about taking control of the project. In December, Cavill said the future of Superman will be more faithful to the comic book source material. After confirming that though his casting in The Witcher had previously interfered with his availability for the role, he also said that the same would not be the case with the show's second season. In January 2020, James Gunn said that he chose directing The Suicide Squad over the next Superman film. The Man of Steel sequel was no longer in active development by May 2020, but Cavill entered negotiations to reprise the role in a different film. Zack Snyder later stated that plans for the plot had included Brainiac and the Kryptonians who were banished to the Phantom Zone at the end of Man of Steel. In November 2021, Cavill reitered his interest in continuing the role.
 In March 2018, Ava DuVernay signed on to direct a film centered around the New Gods, with a script written by Kario Salem. In May 2019, DuVernay announced that she and Tom King would instead co-write the film. Darkseid was planned to be the main antagonist of the film, and the Female Furies were set to appear. In May 2020, DuVernay announced that work on the fourth draft of the script was ongoing. In December 2020, DuVernay said that the COVID-19 pandemic had given her and King time to dig into "the mind and musings of Jack Kirby." King stated that he and DuVernay wanted to honor Kirby's "genius" and described working on the film as "a joy". King said that DuVernay was focused on the emotional core of the characters and the complex relationships that Kirby wrote for them. New Gods was canceled in April 2021, though Warner Bros. stated that it may be revived in the future. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the project faced difficulties due to Darkseid's role in Zack Snyder's Justice League, and Warner Bros. wanted time to pass before the character appeared again. Later, DuVernay revealed that Mister Miracle, Big Barda, Granny Goodness, and Highfather would have appeared in the film.
 In February 2019, Warner Bros. announced a horror-themed spin-off from Aquaman focusing on the villainous Trench kingdom. Peter Safran and James Wan were set to produce, with Noah Gardner and Aidan Fitzgerald writing the script. The film was planned to have a lower production budget than other DCEU films. The following month, Safran stated that he expected the film to be released before Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. In April 2021, The Trench was canceled, though Warner Bros. stated that it may be revived in the future. In October, Wan revealed that Black Manta was planned to be the protagonist of the film.

 Expanded setting 

In October 2014, Geoff Johns explained that DC's approach to their films and television series would be different from Marvel Studios' cinematic universe, stating that their film universe and TV universes would be kept separate within a multiverse to allow "everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to do the best world." This divide lasted until January 2020, when the DCEU was retroactively established to have connections to The CW's Arrowverse continuity via an expansion of the multiverse concept, during Part 4 of the "Crisis on Infinite Earths" crossover. Ezra Miller reprised their role as Barry Allen in a cameo appearance alongside Grant Gustin's version of the same character. During their conversation, Miller's Barry Allen gets the idea to call himself "The Flash" from his alternate self and mentions "Victor". However, despite their cameo, the episode did not confirm the designated Earth for the DCEU characters.

Miller's cameo opened up more possibilities for crossovers between DC films and the Arrowverse. President of DC Films, Walter Hamada, revealed that prior to "Crisis on Infinite Earths", DC had been structured in a way that the television division had to clear the use of characters with the film division. Now, the company could "really lean into this idea of [the multiverse] and acknowledge the fact there can be a Flash on TV and one in the movies, and you don't have to pick one or the other, and they both exist in this multiverse." Arrowverse creator and executive producer Greg Berlanti agreed, feeling that "moving forward, there's more opportunity to do more things like this", and was open to more film characters appearing in the Arrowverse.

In August 2020, Hamada announced plans to develop a multiverse inspired by the comics. In doing so, the studio also stated that all past, present, and future projects are a part of the same unified multiverse. Andy Muschietti, director of The Flash (2022), further explained that all previous adaptations of DC Comics are a part of the multiverse: "...all the cinematic iterations that we've seen before are valid...all that you've seen exists, and everything that you will see exists, in the same unified multiverse".

 Timeline 
In the DCEU, the events of the films never explicitly make their exact years known. Man of Steel takes place after the events of Wonder Woman and Wonder Woman 1984, which are set in 1918 and 1984, respectively. The events of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice occur 18 months after the events of Man of Steel, which follows the consequences and the emergence of aliens and metahumans such as Superman. The film concludes with the death of Superman, which is emphasized in the following ensemble films, Suicide Squad and Justice League, taking place approximately one and two years later, respectively.

Jason Momoa confirmed that Aquaman takes place right after Zack Snyder's Justice League. Aquaman is followed by Shazam!, which occurs during the Christmas season of 2018. Afterwards, the events of Birds of Prey are set in 2020, followed by The Suicide Squad, confirmed to take place in 2021.
